opencv-python  # Added for sharpness detection in ImageDeepfakeDetector
# tensorflow
# Note: Keep tensorflow commented out initially.
# DeepFace runs on either Torch or TF. Installing both on Python 3.13 is risky.
# If your app fails without it, uncomment 'tensorflow' later.

# Enhanced detection features added:
# - Noise pattern analysis using scipy.fft
# - Color distribution analysis using scipy.stats.entropy
# - Voice consistency analysis using librosa MFCC segmentation
# - Breathing pattern detection using librosa RMS
# - Ensemble text classification using multiple transformer models
# - Linguistic pattern analysis for manipulation detection
# - Cross-modal verification for multi-file analysis
# - Logging and analytics dashboard
